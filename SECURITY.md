# Security Framework for Blockchain Recovery Operations

## CRITICAL SECURITY PRINCIPLES

### 1. **Air-Gapped Analysis Environment**
- **NEVER** connect recovery operations to internet during active key handling
- Use offline workstations for private key operations
- Separate analysis environment from key storage/signing environment

### 2. **Zero-Trust Architecture**
- Assume all systems are compromised until proven otherwise
- Multi-factor authentication on ALL systems
- Hardware security keys (YubiKey, Ledger) for critical operations
- Regular security audits of all components

### 3. **Cryptographic Best Practices**
- **NEVER** store private keys in plaintext anywhere
- Use hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) for all key operations
- Implement BIP39 seed phrase security (metal backup, secure storage)
- Use encrypted storage with military-grade AES-256 encryption

## OPERATIONAL SECURITY (OPSEC)

### Development Environment Security
```bash
# Secure Docker container configuration
docker run --rm --network none -v /secure/readonly:/data:ro blockchain-analysis
```

### Network Security
- VPN-only access to collaboration tools
- End-to-end encryption for all communications
- No blockchain operations over public WiFi
- Tor/anonymization for reconnaissance activities

### Data Handling Protocols
1. **Classification Levels:**
   - üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Private keys, seed phrases, hardware wallet PINs
   - üü° **SENSITIVE**: Wallet addresses, transaction IDs, account balances
   - üü¢ **INTERNAL**: Analysis scripts, non-sensitive blockchain data

2. **Storage Requirements:**
   - CRITICAL: Hardware-only storage, never digital
   - SENSITIVE: Encrypted drives with key escrow
   - INTERNAL: Standard encrypted storage

### Team Access Controls
- Role-based access (Analyst, Researcher, Recovery Specialist)
- Time-limited access tokens
- Audit logging of all system access
- Background checks for team members handling CRITICAL data

## TECHNICAL SECURITY MEASURES

### Container Security
```dockerfile
# Security-hardened Dockerfile additions
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' --no-create-home recovery
USER recovery
WORKDIR /tmp
# No persistent storage, read-only filesystem
# Network isolation during key operations
```

### IDL Script Security
```idl
; Security validation in blockchain analysis
pro secure_blockchain_analysis, input_data, output_file, SECURITY_LEVEL=security_level
  compile_opt idl2
  
  ; Validate security level
  if ~keyword_set(security_level) then security_level = 'INTERNAL'
  
  ; Never log sensitive data
  if security_level eq 'CRITICAL' then begin
    print, 'CRITICAL security mode - no logging enabled'
    ; Disable all output except essential results
  endif
  
  ; Encrypt all output files
  if security_level ne 'INTERNAL' then begin
    ; Use GPG encryption for sensitive outputs
    spawn, 'gpg --cipher-algo AES256 --compress-algo 1 --symmetric --output ' + output_file + '.gpg ' + output_file
    file_delete, output_file  ; Remove unencrypted version
  endif
end
```

## INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN

### Compromise Detection
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
- Blockchain transaction monitoring for unexpected movements
- Regular integrity checks of analysis environments

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate isolation** of affected systems
2. **Forensic imaging** before any remediation
3. **Asset securing** - move funds to new, secure addresses
4. **Team notification** via secure, pre-established channels
5. **External security audit** before resuming operations

## LEGAL & COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

### Documentation Requirements
- Maintain detailed custody chains for all recovered assets
- Legal documentation for asset ownership claims
- Compliance with international cryptocurrency regulations
- Tax reporting preparation for recovered assets

### Privacy Protection
- Use of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies (Monero, Zcash) for operational funds
- VPN/Tor for all research activities
- Secure communication channels (Signal, ProtonMail)
- Regular operational security training

## RECOMMENDED SECURITY TOOLS

### Hardware Security
- **YubiKey 5 NFC** - Multi-factor authentication
- **Ledger Nano X** - Hardware wallet for recovered assets
- **Tails OS** - Secure operating system for sensitive operations
- **Faraday bags** - RF isolation for devices

### Software Security
- **Qubes OS** - Compartmentalized security
- **Tor Browser** - Anonymous web access
- **Signal** - Encrypted communications
- **VeraCrypt** - Full disk encryption
- **GPG** - File and communication encryption

### Monitoring & Detection
- **Fail2ban** - Intrusion prevention
- **OSSEC** - Host-based intrusion detection
- **Wireshark** - Network traffic analysis
- **Blockchain monitoring** - Address watchlists

## TEAM SECURITY PROTOCOLS

### Onboarding Security
1. Background verification
2. Security clearance levels assigned
3. Hardware security key issuance
4. Security training completion
5. Signed NDAs and security agreements

### Ongoing Security
- Weekly security briefings
- Quarterly security audits
- Annual penetration testing
- Regular security training updates

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL REMINDER**:
The value of blockchain assets makes this project a high-value target for attackers.
Security is not optional - it's the foundation of successful recovery operations.
