├── src/                    # IDL analysis scripts (.pro)
│   ├── blockchain_recovery_analysis.pro
│   └── sample_team_project.pro
├── config/                 # Blockchain configuration
│   └── blockchain-recovery-config.json
├── data/                   # Analysis datasets
├── notebooks/              # IDL collaborative notebooks (.idlnb)
└── docker-compose.yml      # Containerized analysis environment
```

### Supported Blockchain Targets

**Primary Chains:**
