# IDL Team Collaboration Setup

This directory contains configuration files and guidelines for collaborative IDL development.

## Quick Start

1. **IDL Session**: IDL is now running and ready for team collaboration
2. **Remote Access**: Use VS Code Remote SSH/Tunnels for remote team access
3. **Live Collaboration**: Use Live Share for real-time coding sessions
4. **Version Control**: Git integration for IDL projects

## Team Workflow

### 1. Remote Development Setup
- Use VS Code Remote - SSH for accessing remote IDL installations
- Configure tunnels for secure remote access
- Share development environments with team members

### 2. Live Collaboration
- Start Live Share sessions for real-time collaborative coding
- Share IDL console output and debugging sessions
- Collaborate on ENVI image processing workflows

### 3. IDL Project Structure
```
project/
├── src/           # IDL source files (.pro)
├── data/          # Test data and datasets
├── notebooks/     # IDL notebooks (.idlnb)
├── docs/          # Documentation
└── config/        # Project configuration
```

## IDL Development Best Practices for Teams

### Code Standards
- Use `compile_opt idl2` in all procedures and functions
- Include proper documentation headers
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Add main-level programs for testing

### Collaboration Guidelines
- Use descriptive commit messages for IDL code changes
- Share data processing workflows via IDL notebooks
- Document ENVI processing chains for reproducibility
- Use version control for IDL project files

### Remote Access Configuration
- Port 4080 configured for team access
- SSH tunneling available for secure remote connections
- Live Share integration for real-time collaboration

## Tools Available

1. **IDL Execution**: Run IDL code snippets and files
2. **ENVI Integration**: Image processing and analysis
3. **Notebook Creation**: Create collaborative IDL notebooks
4. **Remote Access**: SSH and tunnel support
5. **Live Share**: Real-time collaboration
6. **Git Integration**: Version control for IDL projects

## Getting Started Commands

### Start IDL Session
```
IDL session is already running and ready for use
```

### Create IDL Notebook
Use the IDL notebook creation tools to create shareable .idlnb files

### Remote Collaboration
1. Start Live Share session from VS Code
2. Share session link with team members
3. Collaborate on IDL development in real-time

## Security Considerations

- Use secure SSH keys for remote access
- Configure proper firewall rules for port 4080
- Use HTTPS for Live Share sessions
- Protect sensitive data in IDL processing workflows
