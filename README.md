# Blockchain Recovery Structuring Project

A comprehensive technical workspace for blockchain asset recovery, analysis, and restructuring across multiple chains and protocols. This project combines advanced IDL analysis tools with collaborative development environments to systematically document, verify, and recover blockchain-based assets.

## Project Overview

This repository serves as the central coordination point for blockchain asset recovery efforts, providing:

- **Multi-chain asset analysis** across BTC, ETH, LTC, STX, BSC, TRX, SOL and other blockchains
- **Genesis mining rewards recovery** and early mining operation documentation  
- **DeFi protocol position analysis** including governance tokens and voting rights
- **Smart contract interaction history** and cross-chain verification
- **Collaborative development environment** with IDL team tools for technical analysis
- **Open bounty coordination** for meaningful technical contributions

## Technical Architecture

### IDL Analysis Environment
The workspace includes professional IDL (Interactive Data Language) tools for blockchain data analysis:

```
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                    # IDL analysis scripts (.pro)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blockchain_recovery_analysis.pro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sample_team_project.pro
â”œâ”€â”€ config/                 # Blockchain configuration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ blockchain-recovery-config.json
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                   # Analysis datasets
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/              # IDL collaborative notebooks (.idlnb)
â””â”€â”€ docker-compose.yml      # Containerized analysis environment
```

### Supported Blockchain Targets

**Primary Chains:**
- Bitcoin (BTC) - Genesis mining rewards, early transactions
- Ethereum (ETH) - Smart contracts, DeFi positions, governance tokens
- Litecoin (LTC) - Mining operation history
- Stacks (STX) - Bitcoin-anchored smart contracts
- Binance Smart Chain (BSC) - BEP20 tokens, PancakeSwap LP
- Tron (TRX) - TRC tokens and TRON DeFi ecosystem
- Solana (SOL) - SPL tokens, NFTs, Solana DeFi protocols

**Layer 2 & Sidechains:** Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism
**DeFi Protocols:** Uniswap, Compound, Aave, MakerDAO, Yearn, Curve

## Getting Started

### Quick Start - Docker Environment
```bash
# Start the blockchain recovery analysis environment
docker compose up -d

# Connect to analysis workspace
docker exec -it social-node-recovery-analysis bash

# Access IDL analysis tools
cd /workspace/src
```

### Team Collaboration Setup
1. **Remote Access**: Use VS Code Remote SSH/Tunnels for distributed team access
2. **Live Share**: Real-time collaborative coding and debugging sessions  
3. **IDL Analysis**: Run blockchain data analysis scripts and notebooks
4. **Remote Tunnel**: Access via `https://vscode.dev/tunnel/SocialNodeandChain`

### Security & Access
- Port 4080: Primary IDL collaboration port
- Secure SSH keys for remote repository access
- Protected analysis environment for sensitive blockchain data
- HTTPS for Live Share sessions and data transmission

## Bounty Program

**Evaluation Period:** Ongoing through August 31, 2025
**Focus Areas:**
- Cross-chain asset verification and recovery methods
- Mining operation and genesis reward documentation
- Smart contract interaction analysis and governance token recovery
- Technical verification of wallet and transaction histories
- Development of automated recovery and analysis tools
