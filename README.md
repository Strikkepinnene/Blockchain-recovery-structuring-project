As I see it, and given the current circumstances, I consider this to be a more constructive and transparent approach to gather a complete and technical overview of assets across various blockchains, Web3 platforms, smart contracts, mining operations, and related ecosystems.

The aim is to document, verify, and recover blockchain-based assets by engaging developers, auditors, and security researchers through an open bounty structure. This repository serves as the central coordination point for:
	â€¢	Documentation of known assets, wallets, and transaction histories
	â€¢	Cross-chain analysis and technical verification
	â€¢	Mining and node operation history where applicable
	â€¢	Coordination of bounties for meaningful technical contributions
	â€¢	Reference to overarching initiatives such as The Social Node

Evaluation of contributors will be ongoing, with a final review and allocation by 31 August 2025.
