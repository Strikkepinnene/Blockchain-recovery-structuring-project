## Project Architecture

### System Components

#### 1. IDL Analysis Environment
**Interactive Data Language (IDL)** serves as the primary analysis platform for blockchain data processing:

```
idl-environment/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                           # IDL analysis scripts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blockchain_recovery_analysis.pro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sample_team_project.pro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ security_validation.pro
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/                     # Collaborative IDL notebooks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Docker Environment Issues

**Issue:** Container fails to start with network isolation
```bash
# Solution: Check Docker network configuration
docker network ls
docker network inspect recovery-net

# Recreate network if needed
docker network rm recovery-net
docker compose up -d
```

**Issue:** Permission denied accessing mounted volumes
```bash
# Solution: Fix volume permissions
sudo chown -R recovery:recovery /home/recovery/workspace
sudo chmod -R 750 /home/recovery/workspace
```

#### IDL Analysis Issues

**Issue:** IDL script compilation errors
```idl
; Solution: Verify compile_opt directive
compile_opt idl2

; Check IDL path configuration
print, !path
!path = !path + ':' + '/home/recovery/workspace/src'
```

**Issue:** Memory errors during large dataset analysis
```idl
; Solution: Implement memory management
heap_gc  ; Force garbage collection
help, /memory  ; Check memory usage

; Process data in chunks
for i = 0, n_elements(large_dataset)-1, chunk_size do begin
  chunk_data = large_dataset[i:min(i+chunk_size-1, n_elements(large_dataset)-1)]
  process_chunk, chunk_data
  heap_gc  ; Clean up after each chunk
endfor
```

#### Security Issues

**Issue:** SSH key authentication failures
```bash
# Solution: Verify key permissions and configuration
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Test connection
ssh -vv recovery@localhost -p 2222
```

**Issue:** VNC connection refused
```bash
# Solution: Check VNC server status and restart if needed
ps aux | grep x11vnc
killall x11vnc
x11vnc -display :0 -usepw -passwdfile ~/.vnc/passwd -listen localhost -forever &
```

### Performance Optimization
