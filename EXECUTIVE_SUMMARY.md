## 🎯 TARGET BLOCKCHAINS

| Blockchain | Symbol | Genesis Date | Focus Areas |
|------------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Bitcoin | BTC | 2009-01-03 | Genesis mining, early rewards |
| Ethereum | ETH | 2015-07-30 | Smart contracts, DeFi, governance |
| Litecoin | LTC | 2011-10-07 | Scrypt mining rewards |
| Stacks | STX | 2021-01-14 | Bitcoin-anchored contracts |
| Binance Smart Chain | BSC | 2020-09-01 | BEP-20 tokens, PancakeSwap |
| Tron | TRX | 2018-06-25 | TRC tokens, TRON DeFi |
| Solana | SOL | 2020-03-16 | SPL tokens, NFTs |

### DeFi Protocol Coverage
- **Uniswap:** LP positions, governance tokens
- **Compound:** Lending positions, COMP tokens
- **Aave:** Variable debt, AAVE tokens  
- **MakerDAO:** CDP positions, MKR governance
- **Curve/Yearn:** LP tokens, yield strategies

## 🔒 SECURITY FRAMEWORK

### Security Levels
- **🔴 CRITICAL:** Private keys, seed phrases (hardware-only storage)
- **🟡 SENSITIVE:** Wallet addresses, balances (encrypted storage)
- **🟢 INTERNAL:** Analysis scripts, public data (standard encryption)

### Core Security Controls
- **Air-Gapped Operations:** Network isolation during key operations
- **Hardware Security:** YubiKey 2FA, Ledger/Trezor wallets required
- **Access Control:** Role-based permissions, key-based SSH only
- **Container Security:** Read-only filesystems, minimal privileges

## 💻 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Development Environment
```
project/
├── src/                    # IDL analysis scripts
├── config/                 # Blockchain configuration  
├── data/                   # Analysis datasets (encrypted)
├── notebooks/              # Collaborative IDL notebooks
└── docker-compose.yml      # Security-hardened containers
```

### Container Security Features
- **Network Isolation:** `network_mode: "none"` for sensitive ops
- **Minimal Privileges:** Non-root execution, dropped capabilities
- **Encrypted Volumes:** Separate storage for sensitive data
- **Read-Only Filesystem:** Prevents tampering
